        <p>We focus on peopleâ€™s needs to determine how design can help them.</p>
        <p>We believe partnerships with people are more valuable than contracts with companies.</p>
        <p>We foster a supportive, creative work environment and take a holistic, intentional approach to projects so that we can provide the best solutions possible.</p>
        <p>We believe that technology should do no harm. We believe that technology can be designed with people at its center and have positive social impact that, when paired with policy and a critical eye to the challenges that society faces, can improve our way of life.
